The deep learning model predicts the price of Airbnb rooms given certain features.The model deals with how different
attributes such as bedrooms,bathrooms, cancelltion policy, room type, review scores, number of reviews etc. can be used to predict the
price of a new listing that is optimal in terms of the hostâ€™s profitability yet affordable to their guests. This model
is intended to be helpful to the internal pricing tools that Airbnb provides to its hosts.
